Stream TV M3U List Converter To HTML Landing Page | Converts an M3U stream list, into a landing page in .html format, to be browsed in the browser.

This application takes a content list file in m3u format, and converts it to a portable .html website, so that it can be browsed both from your internal HD and hosted on a server.
Navigation can be done by mouse or keyboard tab with TAB or SHIFT + TAB to move forward or backward, and enter to open the link on the same page.

Regex was used to find the text patterns to be extracted in the conversion, and the regex may be updated in the future.

The generated page has basic CSS formatting plus a java script snippet.

This application is free with no restrictions on use, it was coded by Alex Lira in vb.net for Winforms in .NET 4.0 using Visual Studio 2012.
As it does not use namespaces from other frameworks, it can be opened in any version from 2012 to the latest higher.

There is a list attached for reference. It was not created by me, just taken from the internet as an example. The CSS style sheet cascade link is pointing to the bootstrap to maintain portability, but it is also attached to the project. When opening the application, and clicking on the browse list button, it will convert the list and save the html file in the same folder as the list and then open it in your browser.

And the main objective of developing this app is to make unnecessary the use of Front Ends + Buggy and heavy Plugins like KODI + Quasar + Others, etc... just to run a simple list.

In the list I provided as an example, almost all the links are to ".magnet" torrent movies. So, if you install a Torrent Media Player on your Windows, such as "Stremio", and associate the .magnets with it, as soon as you choose the movie and press enter it will open your preferred application to watch. In the lists I provided, each list item has a preview image, which is hosted on the list creator's website "blogspot".
